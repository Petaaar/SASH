# Parser folder

### In this folder is contained a slightly-simplified version of the [XMLParser](https://github.com/Petaaar/xmlparser) project.

### How it works?

The classes in this command are evoked when the "append" command is used.   
For example:  
```
append test.sashs
```
Will create a new class in the SASH.Custom namespace, by decoding it from the specified XML-styled __.sashs__ file.  

__*WARNING*__: The program works only with __.sashs__ files, designed in a specific way, witch you can understand [here](https://github.com/Petaaar/XMLParser/blob/master/XMLParser/README.md).
