### The SASH (or Simple Automated Script Headers) Project.

The SASH (or Simple Automated Script Headers) Project is a project, where I, by myself try to 
create simple, yet powerfull command-based system for operating with a files, folders, ect..

### Currently added commands:
1. RUN -> Runs a program. Via the command the program window can be modified as follows:  
'''  
Program name: cmd.exe *minimized*  
Program name: cmd.exe *maximized*  
Program name: cmd.exe *hidden*  
Program name: cmd.exe *normal*  
'''  
> The *italic* words are formal parameter(s). If the program don't find any parameter, the window size will be **normal**.  

2. DELETE -> Deletes one or many files in a specified directory. Not finished yet.  

3. CREATE -> Creates a file or directory, relative to a given arguments.
> Not implemented yet.

4. CLEAR -> Clears the console.  

5. EXIT -> Kills the program. Determines all processes, connected to it.
