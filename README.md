# The SASH System.

### The SASH (or Simple Automated Script Headers) System Project.

The SASH (or Simple Automated Script Headers) System is a project for me to test my coding skills.
The project in a nutshell is a command-based system, like Linux or MacOS, but much more simplified,  so everybody can easely understand the commands and use them.  

### Commands.  
All commands are separated in different folders(namespaces), so everybody can easely navigate through the project.

###### IO folder.  
> For fast navigation to there click [here](https://github.com/Petaaar/SASH/blob/master/SASH/IO/).  

```  
1. RUN, DELETE, CREATE command specs are in the SASH.IO folder.  

2. CLEAR -> Clears the console.  

3. EXIT -> Kills the program. Determines all processes, connected to it.
```  

The [SASH.IO](https://github.com/Petaaar/SASH/blob/master/SASH/IO/) folder contains a number of commands, useful for 
creating, deleting and running an external programs / files.
