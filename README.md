### The SASH (or Simple Automated Script Headers) Project.

The SASH (or Simple Automated Script Headers) Project is a project, where I try to 
create simple, yet powerfull command-based system for operating with a files, folders, ect..

1. RUN, DELETE, CREATE command specs are [here](https://github.com/Petaaar/SASH/blob/master/SASH/IO/README.md).  

2. CLEAR -> Clears the console.  

3. EXIT -> Kills the program. Determines all processes, connected to it.
